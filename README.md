It might be a case that the votes have been tampered. To provide security it is necessary that voters are assured that their vote has been recorded correctly. The proposed system would let a voter verify if his/her vote has been recorded correctly post election. This would allow voters to report if there is any discrepency. Block chain would make it possible to build such a system.
